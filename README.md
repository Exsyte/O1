# Python Web Scraper for Market Odds

This is the back-end data gathering component for a sports analysis tool suite.

It is a Python-based web scraper designed to automatically fetch and parse real-time market odds from a target website (e.g., Betfair/BFX). The gathered data is then processed and stored, where it can be accessed by other services (like a front-end analysis bot).

## Key Features

* **Automated Data Gathering:** Runs as a script to perform web scraping.
* **Data Parsing:** Intelligently extracts specific data points (lay odds, market info) from the site's HTML.
* **Back-End Service:** Acts as the data source for a wider "valuebet" analysis system.

## Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** (Please add the libraries you used here, e.g., **BeautifulSoup, Requests, Selenium, Puppeteer**)
